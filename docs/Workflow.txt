1. Stakeholder needs (from most generic to most specific)
	- stakeholder Mission
	- project value
	- Client Narrative
	- Statement of work
	- Stakeholder Needs Matrix (Numbered list of target features as defined by product manager)
2. Scope of Work
	- Internal Narrative
	- Initial Requirements Breakdown (IRB - based on stakeholder needs)
	- Questions/Assumptions to IRB (Followed by RFIs to clarify answers)
		- Question all gaps
		- Challenge all assumptions
		- 5 W's
			- Who
				- Leads to actors/agents
				- Who will use the system
				- Who will maintain the system
				- How many "whos" inside the system
			- What
				- What are the outputs
				- What are the functions
				- What are the custom events
				- what are the units of measure
				- What are the internal data points?
			- When 
				- when will this operate:  on demand or regular cadence
				- how frequently
				- for how long
			- Where
				- Where should this be stored
				- Where should this be accessible
			- How
				- how will the informaiton handle input/output
				- Will data be stransferred
				- How will the users enter, receive data (Winforms UI, web app, text-based config file)
3. Requirements
	- Agents
		- Users  (one at a time vs multiple concurrent)
		- Maintenance
		- Automations
	- Action Diagrams
		- What are the workflows for each agent? (User input, maintainance modes, output reporting, automated seqences)
4. Data Structures
	- Mapping the Data
		- Whiteboard, figma, sketchpad
		- Identify datapoints
		- Group into collections of data
	- Map Internal Data types to datapoints
		- Identify custom data types
	- Data Transfer (MQTT vs. WebRTC)
	- TCP/IP vs UDP
	- Data ordering
		- For efficiency
		- or random ordering
	- Data Storage (e.g. SQL and/or Text File)
5. Architecture
	- Structure (e.g. Windows Forms application & Class Library)
	- Figma wireframes for UI
	- Custom Events
	- Error Handling
	- Interfaces
	- External communication
		- Email status
		- Texting	
6. Logic Planning
	- Walk through what each peice of the applicaiton is going to do.
	- Bring up each wireframe and break down into separate function identities
	- Breakdown each diagram into classes and methdos.
	- SysML
	- UML Diagrams
	
7. Begin Building code file structure
	- First step in actual coding
	- Configure project types for the entire solution
		- Class Libraries
		- Drivers
		- Interface (Console, WPF, etc)
	- Configure classes	
		- One File Per Object
		- Populate with properties and methods
	- Code will only be stubs of non-functional, but compilable, code.
		- Comment for structure
8. Wire up data structure
9. Test and Adjust
